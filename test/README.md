# *test* Folder

The test folder contains behavior, integration and unit tests as defined in the OpenMSL [OSMP Test Architecture](https://github.com/openMSL/.github/blob/main/doc/osmp_test_architecture.md).

While unit tests test individual functions of the model, integration tests test the model in combination with other connected FMUs.
Behavior tests go one step further and evaluate the model output with a python script.
